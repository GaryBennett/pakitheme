# pakitheme

Automatically install your host GTK+ theme as a Flatpak.

## Usage

Run `pakitheme install-system` and `pakitheme install-user` to grab your current GTK+ theme and
install it as a Flatpak into either the system or user installation, respectively. You can also
pass a theme name, e.g. `pakitheme install-user Adapta`, and pakitheme will install that theme
instead of your current one.

Use `pakitheme clear-cache` to clear the theme storage cache.
